### How to
The main goal repair and reengineer the LX200 controller in a way that the new controller looks exactly like the old one. For this I designed a new case with CAD, that fits to the back case of the LX200 and in which the LX200 main board and the new keyboard fit perfectly. 
Please note that in order to make the part more robust, the small tubes that connect the front to the back case and that hold the main boards have to be printed out separately, and will then be screwed to the case.

The first step is to download the case and button files. I used the CURA slicer and 20% infill, and used standard 1,75mm PLA filament, Black for the body and transparent for the buttons.

The longer Case-Tubes are screwed to the case using M3x10mm countersunk screws, and the smaller PCB tubes are screwed to the case using longer M3x20mm countersunk screws.

After the case and the buttons are printed, and the tubes are screwed, the PCD can be screwed to the front case, and connected to the main board. The Main Board is then screwed to the front case, and the back case is screwed to the front case in the last step.

### How to

In order to get a good visibility of the buttons, we changes them in a sencond version. The first ones were printed out directly, with engraved marks on them. This time, a standard button without engravings were printed with transparent filament multiple times. In a second step, black plates were printed with the engravings. To print the plates, the original engraves buttons were loaded into a slicer. In order to only print the engraves plate and not the complete buttons, the buttons were then moved in the slicer on the Z-Axis below the printing bed, until only the top 1mm was above the printing bed. THis way, the plates can be printed out without redesigning them from scratch. These plates were then glued onto the transparent buttons, to deliver a good contrast with the backlighted pcd. For the glueing, tome soltering tools and tweezers do a good job in positioning the plates.
