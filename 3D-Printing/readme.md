### How to
The main goal repair and reengineer the LX200 controller in a way that the new controller looks exactly like the old one. For this I designed a new case with CAD, that fits to the back case of the LX200 and in which the LX200 main board and the new keyboard fit perfectly. 
Please note that in order to make the part more robust, the small tubes that connect the front to the back case and that hold the main boards have to be printed out separately, and will then be screwed to the case.

The first step is to download the case and button files. I used the CURA slicer and 20% infill, and used standard 1,75mm PLA filament, Black for the body and transparent for the buttons.

The longer Case-Tubes are screwed to the case using M3x10mm countersunk screws, and the smaller PCB tubes are screwed to the case using longer M3x20mm countersunk screws.

After the case and the buttons are printed, and the tubes are screwed, the PCD can be screwed to the front case, and connected to the main board. The Main Board is then screwed to the front case, and the back case is screwed to the front case in the last step.
