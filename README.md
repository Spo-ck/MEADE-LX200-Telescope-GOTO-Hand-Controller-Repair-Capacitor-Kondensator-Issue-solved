# MEADE-LX200-Telescope-GOTO-Hand-Controller-Repair-Capacitor-Kondensator-Issue-solved
The LX200 made by MEADE is a common hand controller for advanced telescopes. However, older version of this remote often have a problem with a tantalum capacitor in the power supply unit: The capacitors like to catch fire after years in operation. When they do, it is also not unlikely that the fire also destroys cable in the remote.  This Project will solve the capacitor issue of the MEADE LX200 controller in 2 steps:  
1. First the broken capacitor will be exchanged 
2. In a second step, a new keyboard with a 3D-Printed case will be made.
